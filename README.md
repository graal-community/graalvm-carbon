### History

Originally it was based on Octane 2.0 sources for V8. Please note that [Octane is retired](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/04/retiring-octane.html) and no longer maintained. Also, it was intended for in-browser tests, but Carbon is intended for server-side tests.

For legacy information, check out the [Octane homepage](https://developers.google.com/octane/), [benchmark reference](https://developers.google.com/octane/benchmark), or [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/octane/faq).
